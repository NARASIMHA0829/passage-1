When a lion was resting in the jungle, a mouse began racing up and down his body for
fun. The lion's sleep was disturbed, and he woke in anger. The lion was going to eat the
mouse when the mouse begged him to let him go, “I promise you, if you save me, I will
be of much help to you in the future.” The lion laughed at the mouse and freed him.
One day, a group of hunters arrived in the forest and captured the lion. They tied the
lion to a tree. The lion began to roar as he struggled to get out. Soon, the mouse
passed by and saw the lion in trouble. The mouse ran to help the lion and started biting
the rope to free the lion. As the rope was cut, both the lion and the mouse ran off into
the jungle.
